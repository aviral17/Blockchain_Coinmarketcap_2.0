[(A)] Server Error
Error: Invalid src prop (https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/cloud/img/coinmarketcap_white_1.svg) on `next/image`, hostname "s2.coinmarketcap.com" is not configured under images in your `next.config.js`

This error happened while generating the page. Any console logs will be displayed in the terminal window.

((Solution)) ---> In next.config.js, REMOVE ` reactStrictMode: true, ` and add (replace with) 
` images: {
    domains: [
      "s2.coinmarketcap.com",
      "s3.coinmarketcap.com",
      "encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com",
    ],
  }, ` 

/* We are doing this as we are using https link in <Image src={https//.....}>, so that link or any other link which me might use in future, will be added to that next.config.js file */
